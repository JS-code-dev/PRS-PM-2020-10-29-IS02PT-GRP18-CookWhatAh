Among others, reasons suggested range from the possibility of leftover ingredients from making a meal leading to food wastage to their inexperience in the kitchen.

Other than just being a mere preference, home-cooked meals also provide other benefits.

CookWhatAh targets both the uninitiated and experienced cooks with the following functionalities:
